    <h1>Question 1: Currency Conversion</h1>
    <p>The work in this reprository reflects my first encounter with React.  Less than 24 hours about I only knew that React was a
    framework similar to Angular and Vue.js.  I knew it was considered a challenge to learn compared to Vue.js yet not as
    difficult to learn as Angular.  Well, twenty hours later I can say that it is definitely not as difficult to learn as
    Angular.  At this stage I'm still a noob at React yet I've acomplished the task.</p>
    <p>In the past, when I have assignments like this, I normally provide richer testing and much nicer looking interfaces.</p>
    <div id="currencyConversion"></div>

    <h1>Question 2: Fix Test Component </h1>
    <p>The following component's code contained several errors (that have been fixed) including.  Click on the 'Test Component' text to increment the click count.</p>
    <uL>
      <li>Fix 1: invoke super constructor</li>
      <li>Fix 2: bind the click handler to this object so the method has access to the instance</li>
      <li>Fix 3: the code attempted to dereference this.click which does not exist. Change to reference the click property in the state</li>
    </uL>

    <h1>Question 3: Series Searcher</h1>
    <p>Select your options as per the assignment document and see the results.
    </p>
    <div id="series"></div>
    <h3>The main calculation function:</h3>
  <pre>
    function question3(inputs) {
	let start = inputs.seriesStart;
	let end = inputs.seriesEnd;
	let incr = inputs.seriesIncrement;
	let type = inputs.seriesType;
	let specifiedDigit = ''+ inputs.specifiedDigit;
	var re = new RegExp(specifiedDigit, 'g');
	let series = [];
	let total = 0;
	for(var i = start; i < end; i += incr) {
		let str = '' + i;
		var count = (str.match(re) || []).length;
		if(type === 1) {
			series.push(i);
			total += count;
		} else if(type === 2) {
			if(i % 2 === 0) {
				series.push(i);
				total += count;
			}
		} else if(type === 3) {
			if(i % 2 === 1) {
				series.push(i);
				total += count;
			}
		}
	}
	inputs.calculatedResults = total;
	inputs.series = series;
  </pre>

    <h1>Question 4: SQL</h1>
    <p>I found the need to learn React took more time than I'd've liked.  The result is Question 4 is incomplete.
    Below is the requested schema and it contains sufficient detail for the requested queries even though it's
    clearly a very simplistic schema. </p>
    <h3>Part A</h3>
  <p>The  <a href="question4/Bookazon.pdf">schema</a> </p>

    <h3>Part b</h3>
    <p>Look into the public/question4 folder and see many sql scripts and csv files that I used to attempt this section.
      The requested queries are typical for a sys admin who works with SQL regularly. Yet, I've not been as active with SQL for
      the last few years as I've focused on other storage tools like MongoDb.  Hence, I frankly struggled to build the complete
      queries as requested.  I was able to create many subqueries that could be used to make the larger, more complex queries.
    </p>
    <h4>Part b.a</h4>
    a.	Who is the best-selling author in each of the last 5 years, by unit volume (the number of books sold), and by sales volume (the total value of their sales)
    <p> This query, <a href="question4/AuthSumTotal2.sql">AuthSumTotal2</a>, selects all authors and lists the total unit sales and sales volume per year. </p>
<p>This sql, <a href="question4/salesByAuthorView.sql">salesByAuthorView</a>, begins the work of creating a view with the above that I was going
to use to select the best selling author for the last 5 years, by units and then by sales</p>
    <h4>Part b.b</h4>
    b.	Who is the best-selling author in each of the last 5 years, by unit volume (the number of books sold), and by sales volume (the total value of their sales) in the category Fiction > Thrillers > Spy Novels
<p>Once the above query is completed this is requires the addition of a where clause applied to the join that brings in book data. </p>

    <h4>Part b.c</h4>
    c.	What city and region (state or province) had the largest sales and unit growth over the past 5 years?
<p>This query will be very similar to the query for part a except that it comes from the point of view of the
customers who buys books rather than the authors who write them. </p>
