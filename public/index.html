    <h1>Question 1: Currency Conversion</h1>
    <p>The work in this repository reflects my first encounter with React.  Less than 24 hours ago I only knew that React was a
    framework similar to Angular and Vue.js.  I knew it was considered a challenge to learn compared to Vue.js yet not as
    difficult to learn as Angular.  Well, twenty hours later I can say that it is definitely not as difficult to learn as
    Angular.  At this stage I'm still a noob yet I've accomplished the essentials of the assignment. The results need polish and some
		 more error handling</p>

    <h1>Question 2: Fix Test Component </h1>
    <p>The following component's code contained several errors (that have been fixed) including.  Click on the 'Test Component' text to increment the click count.</p>
    <uL>
      <li>Fix 1: invoke super constructor</li>
      <li>Fix 2: bind the click handler to this object so the method has access to the instance</li>
      <li>Fix 3: the code attempted to dereference this.click which does not exist. Change to reference the click property in the state</li>
    </uL>

    <h1>Question 3: Series Searcher</h1>
    <p>Select your options as per the assignment document and see the results.
    </p>
    <div id="series"></div>
    <h3>Here is the main calculation function.  This code assumes the caller has completed checks on the inputs before calling this function.</h3>
  <pre>
{
	let start = inputs.seriesStart;
	let end = inputs.seriesEnd;
	let incr = inputs.seriesIncrement;
	let type = inputs.seriesType;
	  // convert number to regexp
	let specifiedDigit = ''+ inputs.specifiedDigit;
	var re = new RegExp(specifiedDigit, 'g');
	  // the results:
	let series = [];
	let total = 0;
	for(var i = start; i < end; i += incr) {
		let str = '' + i;
		var count = (str.match(re) || []).length;
		if(type === 1) {
			series.push(i);
			total += count;
		} else if(type === 2) {
			if(i % 2 === 0) {
				series.push(i);
				total += count;
			}
		} else if(type === 3) {
			if(i % 2 === 1) {
				series.push(i);
				total += count;
			}
		}
	}
	inputs.calculatedResults = total;
	inputs.series = series;

    <h1>Question 4: SQL</h1>
    <p>I found the need to learn React took more time than I'd've liked.  The result was Question 4
	 was answered a little later.  The result is ...
		 complete SQL to create a Bookazon database, complete with test data and the requested
		 queries are all contained in the public/question4 directory.
	 </p> <p>
		 To setup and run the queries you need MySQL and MySQL client.
		 Start by launching the mysql client as root:
	 </p>
	 <pre>
$	cd assignments/public/question4
$   mysql -u root -p
</pre>
	 <p>Next source the scripts to create the data and run the queries. </p>
	 <pre>
	drop database if exists bookazon;
	create database bookazon;
	source bookazon.sql;
	source part_b_a.sql;
	source part_b_b.sql;
	source part_b_c.sql;

</pre>
