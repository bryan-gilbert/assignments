    <h1>Question 1: Currency Conversion</h1>
    <p>The work in this repository reflects my first encounter with React.  Less than 24 hours ago I only knew that React was a
    framework similar to Angular and Vue.js.  I knew it was considered a challenge to learn compared to Vue.js yet not as
    difficult to learn as Angular.  Well, twenty hours later I can say that it is definitely not as difficult to learn as
    Angular.  At this stage I'm still a noob yet I've accomplished the essentials of the assignment. The results need polish and some
		 more error handling</p>

    <h1>Question 2: Fix Test Component </h1>
    <p>The following component's code contained several errors (that have been fixed) including.  Click on the 'Test Component' text to increment the click count.</p>
    <uL>
      <li>Fix 1: invoke super constructor</li>
      <li>Fix 2: bind the click handler to this object so the method has access to the instance</li>
      <li>Fix 3: the code attempted to dereference this.click which does not exist. Change to reference the click property in the state</li>
    </uL>

    <h1>Question 3: Series Searcher</h1>
    <p>Select your options as per the assignment document and see the results.
    </p>
    <div id="series"></div>
    <h3>Here is the main calculation function.  This code assumes the caller has completed checks on the inputs before calling this function.</h3>
  <pre>
{
	let start = inputs.seriesStart;
	let end = inputs.seriesEnd;
	let incr = inputs.seriesIncrement;
	let type = inputs.seriesType;
	  // convert number to regexp
	let specifiedDigit = ''+ inputs.specifiedDigit;
	var re = new RegExp(specifiedDigit, 'g');
	  // the results:
	let series = [];
	let total = 0;
	for(var i = start; i < end; i += incr) {
		let str = '' + i;
		var count = (str.match(re) || []).length;
		if(type === 1) {
			series.push(i);
			total += count;
		} else if(type === 2) {
			if(i % 2 === 0) {
				series.push(i);
				total += count;
			}
		} else if(type === 3) {
			if(i % 2 === 1) {
				series.push(i);
				total += count;
			}
		}
	}
	inputs.calculatedResults = total;
	inputs.series = series;
}

    <h1>Question 4: SQL</h1>
    <p>I found the need to learn React took more time than I'd've liked.  The result is Question 4 is incomplete.
    Below is the requested schema and it contains sufficient detail for the requested queries even though it's
    clearly a very simplistic schema. </p>
    <h3>Part A</h3>
  		<p>The  <a href="question4/Bookazon.pdf">schema</a> </p>

    <h3>Part b</h3>
    <p>Look into the source code's public/question4 folder and see many sql scripts and csv files that I used to attempt this section.
		The assignment requests are complex, although they are typical for a sys admin who works with SQL regularly.
		I've not been as active with SQL for
		the last few years as I've focused on other storage tools like MongoDb.  Hence, it was a struggle to build the complete
		queries as requested, in the given time.  I was able to create many subqueries that I believe will be useful
		to make the larger, more complex queries.
    </p>
    <h4>Part b.a</h4>
    	<p>This query, <a href="question4/AuthSumTotal2.sql">AuthSumTotal2</a>, selects all authors and lists the total unit sales and sales volume per year. </p>
		<p>This sql, <a href="question4/salesByAuthorView.sql">salesByAuthorView</a>, begins the work of creating a view with the above that I was going
			to use to select the best selling author for the last 5 years, by units and then by sales</p>
    <h4>Part b.b</h4>
		<p>Once the above query is completed then this section just needs the addition of a where clause applied to the join that brings in book data. </p>

    <h4>Part b.c</h4>
		<p>This query will be very similar to the query for part (a) except that it comes from the point of view of the
		customers who buys books rather than the authors who write them. </p>
