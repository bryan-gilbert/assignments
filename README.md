# assignments

This repository holds some assignment work.  To use simply clone locally and install and start.

### Prerequisites

Assume you have npm installed.


### Installing

```
   npm install
   npm start
```
In a short while your browser should open with this link <a href="http://localhost:3000/#">http://localhost:3000/</a>.
Yet if you have any other servers using port 3000 the ```npm start``` will prompt you to try another port.
